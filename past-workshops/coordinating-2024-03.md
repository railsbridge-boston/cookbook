## Notes

Smaller turnout than usual with a reversion-to-mean of about 50% no-shows. First event where NERD required 1 week notice of all attendee names, which means we had to turn away students in the days leading up to the event.

Minor morning snag as there was no on-site event coordinator to help with wifi access.

Nick Alberts helped consolidate down the presentation content to reduce unintended redundancy, which improved on the previous workshop (in October, presenters independently created their slide decks without coordinating with anyone else).
