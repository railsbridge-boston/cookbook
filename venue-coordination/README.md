# Venue Coordination

The Venue Coordinator books a venue for the workshop as well as the after-party.

Check out where we've held workshops previously
[here](./previous-workshop-venues.md).

## Decide on a date

For coordinating a date with multiple people, we've found that [Doodle](https://doodle.com) is a great resource.

Also, be aware of other events that may conflict on whatever date you're looking into. Ideally the event shouldn't compete with other well-known events that would cause potential participants or TAs to have a conflict.

If such a conflict is unavoidable, try to make sure a similar conflict didn't occur in a recent event. "Did the last RailsBridge happen on Jogging Day? Try to avoid National Running Day for the next one."

Some places to check for events are:

* Public Boston Events: https://www.boston.gov/events
* Lots of many other Boston events: https://www.bostonusa.com/events/events-calendar/
* Jewish Holidays: https://www.hebcal.com/holidays/
* Boston Public School Calendar: https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/calendar#calendar1/20180509/month
* Cambridge Public School Calendar: https://www.cpsd.us/calendar

## 3-5 months before (or as soon as a date is set)

Find a workshop venue based on [these guidelines](venue-guidelines.md#workshop-venue). Work with registration to coordinate an end date for RSVPs (so we have time to finalize attendee lists for security and food planning, etc).

## 2 weeks before

Find and book a bar/restaurant for our after-party at least a week in advance.
See the guidelines
[here](/venue-coordination/README.md#after-party-venue-guidelines).

## 2-7 days before

If the venue has building security, they generally require a list of everyone who will be attending the workshop (Note - Microsoft NERD requires *1 week* ahead of time!). If so, do the following:

* Get a guest list from the Registration Coordinator. This should include:
  - students
  - volunteers (TAs, organizers, etc.)
  - sponsors
  - child care providers
  - children?
* Send your venue Point of Contact the guest list.
