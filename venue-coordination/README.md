# Venue Coordination

The Venue Coordinator books a venue for the workshop as well as the after-party.

Check out where we've held workshops previously
[here](./previous-workshop-venues.md).

## Finding A Date

For coordinating a date with multiple people, we've found that [Doodle](https://doodle.com) is a great resource.

Also, be aware of other events that may conflict on whatever date you're looking into. Ideally the event shouldn't compete with other well-known events that would cause potential participants or TAs to have a conflict.

If such a conflict is unavoidable, try to make sure a similar conflict didn't occur in a recent event. "Did the last RailsBridge happen on Jogging Day? Try to avoid National Running Day for the next one."

Some places to check for events are:

* Public Boston Events: https://www.boston.gov/events
* Lots of many other Boston events: https://www.bostonusa.com/events/events-calendar/
* Jewish Holidays: https://www.hebcal.com/holidays/
* Boston Public School Calendar: https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/calendar#calendar1/20180509/month
* Cambridge Public School Calendar: https://www.cpsd.us/calendar

Space:
* Is there another person from the company that will be helping us?
* Are there power strips (~4)? Are there sufficient outlets in the floor/along the walls?
* Can the HVAC be adjusted during the event? If not, how do we ensure the temperature is comfortable? (Note: having 100 people in a room will make it very warm.)

Childcare:
* Dedicated area for babysitter + children

Bathroom:

## After-Party Venue Guidelines

### Criteria:

Calling the venue about a week ahead of time should be fine.
