# Venue Guidelines

## Workshop Venue

### Timeframes

|Day|Time|
|---|---|
|Saturday|9:00am-5:30pm|

This includes an extra 30 minutes on the bookends of the timeframe for catering deliveries, setup, and teardown.

### Criteria to ask when looking for a space

We have many requirements, preferences, and nice-to-haves for coordinating a space. Listed in order of necessity:

#### Top priority (we likely cannot make a space work if one of these is missing)

* Free, preferably
* Can hold 50-100 people (plan for about 50 students, plus TAs, organizers, and space for setting up food if there is not a separate "kitchen" area)
* As accessible as possible (e.g. easy access to the T, parking available, has elevators if the event space is not on the first floor)
* Allows childcare (we don't always need it, likely shouldn't accept venues with a no-children policy)
* Has a decent presentation setup (desks, microphones, projector, outlets)

#### High Priority

* Has all genders restrooms (or will at least let us relabel restrooms temporarily for event)
* Space for childcare is separate from event space
* Allows for any caterer

#### Nice-to-Haves

* Has a separate kitchen area for food and drinks
* Has a private mother's room that locks from the inside
* Has someone from the company who will be helping us (or an Organizer works there)

### Questions to ask when evaluating a possible space

Presentation:
* Are there microphones? Are they rechargeable? Does the venue supply you with replaceable batteries?
* Is there a microphone stand? Wireless?
* How do you lower the projector?

Space:
* Is there another person from the company that will be helping us?
* Are there power strips (~4)? Are there sufficient outlets in the floor/along the walls?
* Can the HVAC be adjusted during the event? If not, how do we ensure the temperature is comfortable? (Note: having 100 people in a room will make it very warm.)

Accessibility:
* Is it wheelchair accessible?
* Is it easily accessible by public transit?

Childcare:
* Dedicated area for babysitter + children
* Is there a motherâ€™s room that can be locked from the inside?

Bathroom:
* Is there a gender neutral bathroom?

Security:
* How far in advance do we need to give the venue our guest list?:
* Is there a security guard downstairs? Who do we give the guest list to?
* Do we have access to the building over the weekend? Is the building door locked?

Catering
* Are all caterers allowed?

### Questions to ask when the weekend of the event

Wifi:
* Password?
* SSID?

Space:
* How do you dim the lights?
* Is there a room where you can store the supplies for the night?
* Will there be construction during the time of the venue?
* Is the conference room locked? (since the event occurs on the weekends and after work hours)

Trash
* If the trash overflows what can we do?

## After-Party

### Criteria

* Within walking distance
* Holds at least 20-30 people, sitting and/or standing

Calling the venue about a week ahead of time should be fine.

See [this doc](./previous-after-party-venues.md) for where we've gone before.
