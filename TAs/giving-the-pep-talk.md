# TA Pep Talk

## Friday

Get the TAs all together and emphasize the following points:

* Never, ever take the keyboard away from people. It's hard, but guide them
  through doing things themselves.
* Windows is generally harder to set up than other OSes. Please don't make jokes
  about how "windows sucks" - it's hard enough to be here without that, and
  people will hear it.
* Support other TAs when they present. It also helps to be available in case the presenter gets a tricky question. Feel free to raise your hand if you can help answer it. It's also okay to take break during presentations. Resting your feet is fine, but please take any conversations outside.
* Try not use words like "simple", "easy", or "just". The attendees are _brand new_ and it isn't easy! Encourage their questions and make them feel like they're doing it right by running into problems
* The thumb drives are not for students to keep. We need those all back!

## Saturday

Get the TAs all together and emphasize the following points:

* Go over [Friday] points again
* Sometimes people just don't ask questions. Check in with people every so
  often; a quick "Can I help anyone? Are you suuuure?" can go a long way.
* Encourage TAs to give out their contact information if they want to.

## Introductions

TAs will also be asked at the beginning of each day to get up in front of the room and introduce themselves. Remind them with something like this:

> During tonight's event, So-and-so, our MC, will call all the TAs up to the stage for a brief introduction and thank you. Each TA will introduce themselves by sharing their name, pronouns, and someone who has helped you on your coding journey.
>
> Example: "My name is Stephanie. I go by the pronouns 'she' and 'her'. I have received help from so many people, it's hard to choose just one. The two people that have helped me the most are friend So-and-so for their emotional support and my brother, who is a developer."
