# TA Pep Talk

## Friday

Get the TAs all together and emphasize the following points:

* Never, ever take the keyboard away from people. It's hard, but guide them
  through doing things themselves.
* Windows is generally harder to set up than other OSes. Please don't make jokes
  about how "windows sucks" - it's hard enough to be here without that, and
  people will hear it.
* Be careful using jargon as it might be intimidating.
* Emphasize that it's really hard to break a computer by typing something wrong
  into the terminal.
* Support other TAs when they present. It also helps to be available in case the presenter gets a tricky question. Feel free to raise your hand if you can help answer it. It's also okay to take break during presentations. Resting your feet is fine, but please take any conversations outside.
* Try not use words like "simple", "easy", or "just". The attendees are _brand new_ and it isn't easy! Encourage their questions and make them feel like they're doing it right by running into problems
* The thumb drives are not for students to keep. We need those all back!

## Saturday

Get the TAs all together and emphasize the following points:

* Go over [Friday] points again
* Sometimes people just don't ask questions. Check in with people every so
  often; a quick "Can I help anyone? Are you suuuure?" can go a long way.
* Remind participants that there are no "stupid questions".
* Encourage participants to post their question(s) in the Slack channel or Google
  doc as well as the answer if/when they have it. That way they can help others
  who might be wondering the same thing.
* It can be easy to cluster with the other TAs when it looks like participants
  don't need help. While talking to other TAs is fine, it can be intimidating
  for a participant to interrupt conversations.
* It's ok for TAs not to know the answer to every question. TAs should not feel
  bad asking other TAs for help. It actually sets a good example.
* If there are error messages, explain what they mean and how they
  point to where the problem might be.
* Encourage TAs to give out their contact information if they want to.
