# TA Pep Talk

## Friday

Get the TAs all together and emphasize the following points:

* Never, ever take the keyboard away from people. It's hard, but guide them
  through doing things themselves.
* Windows is generally harder to set up than other OSes. Please don't make jokes
  about how "windows sucks" - it's hard enough to be here without that, and
  people will hear it.
* Be careful using jargon as it might be intimidating.
* Support other TAs when they present. It also helps to be available in case the presenter gets a tricky question. Feel free to raise your hand if you can help answer it. It's also okay to take a break during presentations. Resting your feet is fine, but please take any conversations outside.
* Try not use words like "simple", "easy", or "just". The attendees are _brand new_ and it isn't easy! Encourage their questions and make them feel like they're doing it right by running into problems
* The thumb drives are not for students to keep. We need those all back!

## Saturday

Get the TAs all together and emphasize the following points:

* Go over [Friday] points again
* Sometimes people just don't ask questions. Check in with people every so
  often; a quick "Can I help anyone? Are you suuuure?" can go a long way.
* Remind participants that there are no "stupid questions".
* Encourage participants to post their question(s) in the Slack channel or Google
  doc as well as the answer if/when they have it. That way they can help others
  who might be wondering the same thing.
* It can be easy to cluster with the other TAs when it looks like participants
  don't need help. While talking to other TAs is fine, it can be intimidating
  for a participant to interrupt conversations.
* It's ok for TAs not to know the answer to every question. TAs should not feel
  bad asking other TAs for help. It actually sets a good example.
* If there are error messages, explain what they mean and how they
  point to where the problem might be.
* Encourage TAs to give out their contact information if they want to.

## Introductions

TAs will also be asked at the beginning of each day to get up in front of the room and introduce themselves. Remind them with something like this:

> During tonight's event, So-and-so, our MC, will call all the TAs up to the stage for a brief introduction and thank you. Each TA will introduce themselves by sharing their name, pronouns, and someone who has helped you on your coding journey.
>
> Example: "My name is Stephanie. I go by the pronouns 'she' and 'her'. I have received help from so many people, it's hard to choose just one. The two people that have helped me the most are friend So-and-so for their emotional support and my brother, who is a developer."
