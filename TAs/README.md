# TAs

Our TAs are a huge part of the workshop experience for our participants. It's
important that we take great care in both selecting the TAs and preparing them
for an upcoming workshop.

This folder contains a bunch of information on that stuff.

## 2-3 weeks before

As soon as TA applications come in, we should start reviewing and responding to them.

For each workshop, we typically open up more slots for TAs than we actually
need. From the pool of applicants, we try our best to do the following:

* Have a 1:3 ratio of TAs to students.
* Select a diverse set of TAs that'd represent different backgrounds such as
technical experience, gender, etc.

## Friday

Remind the TAs about the kind of conduct we expect and how to talk to new
programmers. Look at our [Friday TA pep talk](giving-the-pep-talk.md#friday).

## Saturday

Remind the TAs again about the kind of conduct we expect and how to talk to new
programmers. Look at our [Saturday TA pep talk](giving-the-pep-talk.md#saturday).
