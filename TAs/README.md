# TAs

Our TAs are a huge part of the workshop experience for our participants. It's
important that we take great care in both selecting the TAs and preparing them
for an upcoming workshop.

This folder contains a bunch of information on that stuff.

## Volunteering as a TA

If someone is interested in becoming a TA for an upcoming workshop, they must
register through our event signup page. However, these slots usually fill up
quick so if they miss out this workshop, they can sign up for our [volunteer
mailing list] to hear about the next one.

## TA Selection

For each workshop, we typically open up more slots for TAs than we actually
need. From the pool of applicants, we try our best to do the following:

* Have a 1:3 ratio of TAs to students.
* Select a diverse set of TAs that'd represent different backgrounds such as
technical experience, gender, etc.
