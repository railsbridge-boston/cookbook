This is a guide for our TA's on how to prepare for the workshop.

First off though, thanks for volunteering and making this happen. Over the years
of running these workshops, we've consistently gotten feedback on how amazing
the TA's were. We're very excited to have you be a part of this experience.

Please familiarize yourself with the curriculum:
* Rails: http://docs.railsbridgeboston.org/intro-to-rails/

We recommend that you go through the steps at least once and build everything
out so that you can get an idea as to what kind of questions may pop up.

Many of you have been through this before, but do it anyway just in case there
have been any significant changes.

You may also want to get some helpful advice and information about being a TA.
RailsBridge has a page of resources and tips for workshop teachers:
http://www.railsbridge.org/help/teach

...and a deck you can go through with some more ideas on creating a welcoming
classroom environment, teaching beginners, etc:
http://docs.railsbridge.org/workshop/more_teacher_training

These workshops are always fun and inspiring. You're going to be a huge help to
these students who are just getting started with Ruby or Rails.

We encourage you to help each other out, get to know the other TA's and
volunteers, and just enjoy yourself.

Looking forward to seeing you all on Friday!
