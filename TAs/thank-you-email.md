Dear RailsBridge TAs,

We wanted to thank you so much for helping students learn to program this last weekend. We consistently get feedback that our TAs are great, and this workshop was no exception.

Special shoutout to those of you who gave presentations. They're not easy to do and we really appreciate the effort you put in. Your excellent presentations and thoughtful 1-on-1 discussions made the participants leave excited and energized about coding.

Hopefully you'll come back and volunteer at another event sometime. If you'd like, you can sign up for our volunteer mailing list: http://eepurl.com/bjdkKv Either way, please keep in touch!

Name - TA Coordinator
Name - RailsBridge Organizer
