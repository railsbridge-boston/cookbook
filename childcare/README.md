# Childcare Coordination

Thanks for volunteering to do childcare! It will be your job to book a sitter (or more than one) so that parents can come to the workshop for free. You'll handle finding sitters, communicating between the sitter and the parents, paying the sitter (you'll be reimbursed), and generally keeping everything around childcare flowing smoothly.

Here's how it works (also explained in the registrion process):
* We use [UrbanSitter], where one or more sitters come to our venue to watch the children at no cost to the parents.
* thoughtbot will pay for childcare but they need a receipt.
  - If you can, pay for the sitter yourself and we can get a reimbursement afterwards. If you're not comfortable with that, please ask about getting RailsBridge to pay up front.

## 2 weeks before

People's plans change, so we want to make sure that those who requested childcare still need it.

* Get a list from the Registration Coordinator with the names, phone numbers, and email addresses of the students interested in getting childcare.
* Send an email to them asking to confirm.
  - A mass email with everyone BCC'ed should work.
  - Make sure you give them a deadline to respond by.

## Week of

_Keep in mind that this is a pretty tight timeline to make sure parents can get back to you with childcare needs and book a sitter so you'll need to make sure you're on top of this._

To book a sitter you'll need:
  * the RailsBridge UrbanSitter login (in 1Password)
  * the number of children who need childcare


Then:  
* Log onto [UrbanSitter] and start booking a sitter.
* Pick a sitter explicitly **or** post the job to the sitter community.
  - Posing to the wider community is the recommended approach because we got about 20 responses within a couple of days.
  - We aim for about $20/hour for a sitter.
* Keep in touch with that sitter during the process so they know what to expect (how to get in the venue, when meals are, any special child needs, or anything else).
* Greet the sitter at the start of the event and help them get setup in their space.
* Check in with them periodically during the event to see if they need anything (food, supplies, etc).
* UrbanSitter will send you a bill. Save this as a PDF to send to thoughtbot. You can send that PDF to someone who works at thoughtbot and they can start the reimbursement process for you.
