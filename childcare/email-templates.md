Hi there!

I saw that you've opted in for child care at the workshop next weekend. Awesome!
I just have a few followup questions:

* Are you still planning on attending?
* If so, do you need care for both Friday AND Saturday?
* If not, which day(s) do you need?

Please let me know ASAP so that I can make the appropriate arrangements.

Thanks,
