# Catering

Catering is the biggest budget item for RailsBridge and a major part of the
event. We typically do the following, based on 50-60 people at the workshop:

## Instructions

Here's what to do:
* Place catering orders about 1.5 weeks ahead of the workshop.
* Delivery times might be roughly: Friday 6:30pm, Saturday 8:45am, Saturday 11:30am
* Ask caterer when they want to be paid, e.g. on delivery, after the event, etc.
* Make sure we cover those who have dietary restrictions. Dietary restrictions
are a question on the registration form.
  * Ask the caterer about peanut-allergy-safe foods, gluten-free, etc.
* Work with registration and TA coordinators to get head counts and dietary
restrictions.
* Add a few more "servings" for some wiggle room.
* Be sure we're leaving the space in a good state.
  * **Be green** Ask the venue's contact person about disposing trash -- how
they would like us to handle that.

Here's an example email to a catering inbox:
> Hello from Railsbridge Boston!
> 
> I'd like to order for delivery to:
> 150 Bdwy, 2nd Floor, Cambridge, MA 02142
> 
> for Saturday 11:30AM, April 6.
> 
> Assorted Taco Bar Makes 125 tacos (approx 50 people)
> 
> Large Salad Bowl (serves 30) 
> 
> Classic Burrito Tray: 30 Regular Burritos
> 
> Can you provide a quote and invoice so we can use our tax exempt status? Thanks!
> 
> 
> Estimated headcount: 60 people
> 
> Organization: Railsbridge Boston

## Payment

The Catering Coordinator should be placing the orders first. The vendors will
tell her when payment is due for the food. Usually, they will take credit card
payments over the phone. Ask caterers for a tax-exempt invoice. Provide the Bridge 
Foundry 501c3 determination letter if asked for a tax-exempt certificate.

Work with Melissa for payment. 

For the after-party, payment is made right there to the bartender during the
after-party. There may be a room reservation fee or minimum drink and appetizer
purchase amount depending on the venue. Use the RailsBridge Boston Bridge
Foundry debit card.

## Dietary restrictions & food allergies
Label food so that people with dietary restrictions & food allergies can easily identify food they can eat. Try to set food up to not cross contaminate.

## Friday night: pizza and drinks - ~$500

Cost: ~$500

* Try to find a pizza shop that can do a vegan pizza and a gluten-free pizza. 
* Make sure at least one salad is both gluten and dairy-free.
* Be at the venue when the delivery arrives before Friday night.

## Saturday daytime: breakfast, snacks, lunch - ~$1,500
* AM coffee and breakfast: Haley House, Flour Bakery have worked in the past
* PM coffee: Dunkin Donuts - 4 Boxes o' Joe
* Afternoon snacks: pick up beforehand or use Instacart. Get a mix of cookies, trail mix, apples, and juice. READ LABELS FOR ALLERGENS
* Lunch: Burritos/build-your-own-bowl meals are a popular staple, since they accomodate most diets

## Saturday night: after-party drinks and appetizers - ~$700

* Based on 30-40 of the 50-60 attending.
* Depending on attendance, only offer the first round of drinks. Feel free to
add another round and/or some appetizers as budget allows.
