  ever coded? (one for each day).

  ask them to briefly talk about their company.
* Welcome everyone. Remind everyone that coding is hard.
* This is a self-paced workshop and there's no competition to finish quickly.

  sometimes struggle with coding at work and need to ask for help.
* Have the TAs hand out sticky notes, and explain that students should place them
  on their laptops if they want to flag down a TA.

  and what is easy for their neighbor might be hard for them.
