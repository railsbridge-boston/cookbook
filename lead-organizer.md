# Lead Organizer

## Ongoing

### Answering email

This is year-round task that involves monitoring the inbox and answering any
questions about the organization or the events we run.

We use [Inbox by Zendesk][inbox] to manage emails sent to the RBB. Anything that
is sent to the RBB address is automatically forwarded to our personal ones.

If there are multiple people managing the inbox, please make sure to assign
yourself to the email threads that you are participating in. If a conversation
is complete, please also mark it as "Done".

Checking in on a weekly basis in between workshops should suffice. As we get
closer to a workshop though, the inbox should be checked more frequently since
people may have last-minute questions, cancellations, or maybe child care requests.

It would also be good to check often right after a workshop has happened as
well.
