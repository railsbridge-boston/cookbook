Hi there!

Thank you for volunteering to be a TA for the November RailsBridge Boston workshop!

In order to best prepare you for your role as a TA, we ask that you sign up for a 30 minute information session which will be held over Google Hangouts. This will be in a group setting, and we’ll go over what to expect during to workshop, TA best practices, and give you a chance to meet the other TAs and ask any questions you may have.

Here is a link to a doodle poll with the time slots: <Link>.

We’ll be holding a few sessions, so select whatever times work for you. After you’ve completed the poll, we'll get back to you with which session you'll be in. Please fill this out by <Deadline>! In the event that none of the times work, please email <Your Name> at <Your Email> to set something up.

We’re looking forward to working with you!

<Your Name>
TA Coordinator
