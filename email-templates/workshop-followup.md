Hi everyone,

Thank you so much for attending a RailsBridge Boston workshop! We hope that you
enjoyed the weekend learning how to program and build your first web
application.

We also appreciate all the valuable feedback we received throughout the
workshop and will do our best to incorporate it into our future workshops.

As promised, you can find a list of the slides from the workshop on this
document: <INSERT URL>

For more ways to further your learning, you can also check out our Resources
page: http://www.railsbridgeboston.org/resources.

If you enjoyed our workshop, we'd love to have you come back to us as a
volunteer. Sign up for our volunteers mailing list if you're interested in this
opportunity: http://eepurl.com/bjdkKv.

Another great way to give back is by supporting us through donations. Our
workshops are always free to participate and completely run by volunteers. The
food and drinks at each workshop are typically covered by our sponsors, but
there are also miscellaneous expenses like supplies and software fees that help
us keep our workshops organized and running. If you'd like to make a small
contribution to support us, please visit http://railsbridgeboston.org/donate.

Once again, thank you for joining us at the RailsBridge Boston workshop and
making it a huge success!

Sincerely,

The RailsBridge Boston Team
