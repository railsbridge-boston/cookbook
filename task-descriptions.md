## Email inquiries
Time commitment: 30 minutes per week, ongoing

You will get access to the RailsBridge Boston email account. The person in
charge of admissions will respond to admission-related emails. But your job is
to answer the other ones until the date of the workshop.

## Social media
Time commitment: minimal

We have a Twitter account: [@RailsBridgeBos](https://twitter.com/railsbridgebos).

Responsibilities:
* Announce the opening of registration - work with registration person
* Announce the posting of our workshop recap - work with recap person

Keep an eye on time - allow for flexibility, but also make sure we're moving along.

### Friday night
* Welcome everyone

* TA introductions - name, what they do and fun fact
* Go over the plan for the night
 * point them to the pages with instructions

## Photography
Time commitment: part or all of the workshop; selecting && emailing photos afterward

* Take brilliant pictures.

## Curriculum

* Oversee updates and improvements to the RailsBridge web-based curriculum.
* Coordinate a full walk-through of the curriculum on each platform with the TAs.
 * Pay particular attention to the versions of all software used.

## Installfest
Time commitment: be at workshop Friday night, ~5 hours prep the week before

The Installfest is a time dedicated to help students install the software needed
for the workshop onto their laptops.

The coordinator:
* Reviews installation instructions.
* Makes sure the virtual machine image is online and up to date
* Makes sure that all the flash drives contain the software we'll need.
* Makes sure that the flash drives are brought to both days of the workshop.
* Is the main point of contact at the workshop if there are any question or issues.

Other notes:
* You do not have to be an expert on every OS, but be aware of which TAs are
knowledgeable about troubleshooting issues for each OS.
* You will know in advance as to what hardware the students will be bringing, so
prepare for coverage accordingly.

## Teaching Staff
* Recruit around 25-30 awesome teaching assistants, and people to give all the
mini-lectures.
* Give the TAs tips on how to do their job well.
* Tell them to prep by going through the Saturday curriculum and the Virtual
Machine version of the Installfest for their operating system.

## e-books and Giveaways
Time commitment: ~2 hours, 1-2 weeks before the workshop

O'Reilly has supported us in the past by providing free e-book giveaways to our workshop attendees and TAs.

* Contact O'Reilly to ask if they can offer free e-book selections again. Get contact info for O'Reilly from a workshop organizer.  Points to include in the email:
    * introduce yourself
    * it's for RailsBridge Boston - give them the workshop dates, and that we expect 90 students + 30 TAs
    * ask if they can offer free e-books again
    * a big thank you.  They've been very generous.
    * cc the email to railsbridgeboston@gmail.com - our mail archive helps us have more continuity between events

* O'Reilly will provide instructions for how students can request an e-book.  They will set up a code for the event.
* Work with the post-workshop survey coordinator to add this to the confirmation page:

> Visit http://oreilly.com/go/ebookrequest and follow the instructions, you can choose any title from their entire collection.  Note that you need to have an account with oreilly.com in order to fill out the form. In the field "Event where you won the book" enter:

... and fill in the event code O'Reilly gave us.

## Sponsorships

* Contact potential sponsors *at least* 1 month in advance.
 * Reach out to companies who've sponsored in the past *first*.
 * Reach out to other companies who've never sponsored before. They don't *have
to* be a Ruby or Rails shop, and you can show them our
[prospectus](http://www.railsbridgeboston.org/prospectus.pdf) for more details.
* Write a "thank you" email after the workshop.

Other notes:
* [thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com) is an ongoing sponsor. This means there's
no need to ask them for sponsorship each time, but we should give Chad Pytel
the heads up when a workshop is coming.
 * The thoughtbot sponsorship includes paying for childcare and providing
discount coupons for Learn Prime. The coupon gives each student 50% off their
first month of [Learn Prime](http://learn.thoughtbot.com).
   * Prime is guided learning from thoughtbot, where students get to everything
thoughtbot teaches, including in-person workshops, chat rooms and forums
staffed by the Rails developers at thoughtbot, starting at $29/month.

#### How to move the money:

With the help of [Bridge Foundry], we now have a debit card to pay vendors with.
All catering orders and the after-party tab are paid using this card. Please ask
a lead organizer for access to instructions on how to load up this card.

Catering orders are generally paid over the phone or online, depending on the
vendor.

The after-party tab can be paid in-person at the time of the after-party
(recommended) or in advance over the phone. There may be a room reservation fee
or minimum drink/appetizer purchase amount depending on the venue.

[Bridge Foundry]: http://bridgefoundry.org/

## Venue

Time commitment: 3-4 hours, find and book 4-6 months in advance and then
follow-up closer to workshop dates

See [How-To: Venue](./venue.md)

## Catering

Time commitment: 3-4 hours, check for dietary restrictions, find caterers, place
orders

See [How-To: Catering](./catering.md)

## Registration
Time commitment: ~20 hours, starting 3 weeks before the workshop, plus be present Friday night
* Set up an EventBrite event (~1 hour total)
* While registration is open, check the Gmail account for questions and keep an
eye on registration. ( ~1 hour/day the week registration opens, ~30 minutes/day after the workshop fills, ~5 hours the week before the workshop managing wait list and final emails)
* During the week of the workshop, manage email, registration/waitlist, and
coordinate with the catering/venue and childcare coordinators.
* On Friday, you'll check people in with the Eventbrite as they arrive. It's best to have 2 or 3 people do check-in.

There's a detailed [How To: Registration](./How To: Registration.md) page.

## Childcare
Registration provides a list with the names, phone numbers, and email addresses
of the students interested in getting childcare.

Registration should also explain how it works:
* We use [Parents in a Pinch](http://www.parentsinapinch.com/), where one sitter
comes to the attendee's house with no cost to the attendee.
* thoughtbot pays directly to PiaP.
* Parent can't replace PiaP with their own sitter because thoughtbot can't
reimburse the expense.
* We'll call them closer to the workshop dates to confirm ther need for backup
childcare.

On the week of the workshop, confirm they still need childcare as they may have
changed their plans.

Call PiaP and:
* Say that we're running a workshop called "RailsBridge Boston", where a sponsor
will be covering backup (in-home) childcare for our attendees.
* Mention when the workshop is happening.
* Mention that thoughtbot will call and provide payment information.
* Tell them the expected number of parents requesting the service.
* Get a deadline from them as to when the parent should call in by.

Ask thoughtbot to make the call and provide CC info.

Contact each (confirmed) parent and have them call PiaP with the following
information:
* They're requesting childcare paid through a RailsBridge Boston sponsor
* Number of children they need care for and their ages
* Street address
* Days and hours in which they would require care
* Phone number

One of the last few times childcare was actually requested, the cost was
structured as $30/hr with a 4 hour minimum. There is a $30 cancellation fee for
each sitter.

Check the PiaP website for any updates on how any of this might work and then
update these instructions accordingly.

[PiaP]: http://www.parentsinapinch.com/

Thank you [thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com/), you're are awesome!

## Feedback survey and post-workshop email

* Create a survey via Google Forms and share it with the organizers.
* Send an email to the workshop attendees with a link to the survey.

When we send the survey, we need to write a very important letter: we motivate
the graduates to keep learning and getting involved, we thank the sponsors, etc.

## Post-workshop blog post/write-up

Write an article reviewing the workshop.

Content to include:
* photos
* feedback from survey
* a "thank you" to your sponsors

You can see some examples here:
