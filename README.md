# RailsBridge Boston Cookbook

This is the RailsBridge Boston cookbook, which includes various "How to" and
planning documents. This README is the timeline for planning a workshop.

Ask a lead organizer for access to credentials to the various services we use.

Here's a list of roles that are involved in organizing a workshop:

* 1-2 Lead Organizers
* Venue Coordinator - The venue may change with each workshop. Whoever does it
should commit to owning the process and maintaining communication with the venue
contact(s).
* Registration Coordinator
* Catering Coordinator
* Sponsorship Coordinator
* TA Coordinator
* Child Care Coordinator
* Installfest Coordinator
* MC

**Interested in being a TA?** Get on our [volunteer mailing list] to hear when the next signup is!

## 6 months before

### Venue Coordinator

Book a venue for the event. See
[guidelines](/venue-coordination/README.md#workshop-venue-guidelines).

## 8 weeks before (Sponsorship Coordinator)

Start emailing potential sponsors. There's more info in the [finances
document](/finances.md).

## 1.5 weeks before (Catering Coordinator)

Find 2-3 different vendors that we can work with. If our venue has a specific
list of vendors we can use, please accommodate that.

Get a CSV of all the attendees, including TAs, to get a rough head count and a
sense of what the dietary restrictions are.

Assume about 60% of the people who registered + number of TA's will attend.  For
more information, see [this document](/catering.md).

## 1 week before

### Venue Coordinator

Find and book a bar/restaurant for our after-party at least a week in advance.
See the guidelines
[here](/venue-coordination/README.md#after-party-venue-guidelines).

### Installfest Coordinator

Make sure the docs are updated and any changes to Installfest VMs are live on
the website.

Run the [spoon-building
script](https://github.com/railsbridge-boston/spoon-builder) to update the
download files.

### MC

Prepare a slide deck with:

* Sponsor logos
* Link to Friday/Saturday Google docs
* Schedule for Friday/Saturday

We have sample slide decks in [the MC directory](/mc).
We have a more detailed outline for MCing [here](/mc/mc-tips.md).

### Child Care Coordinator

View the registrations and check for those who've opted in for child care. Send
them an email (all BCC'ed), explaining how it works, have them confirm that they
still need care, and if so, ask them for details about their children (age,
gender, special needs, which days and how long they need care for).

Give them 2-3 days to respond to you.

Use Sitter City to find a sitter that would accommodate the children that need
care. Be sure to coordinate how payment will work with the sitter.

## 3 days before

### Venue Coordinator

Send the venue a list of names of everyone who might be there.

* It must be submitted 3 days in advance so they can distribute it to the
  security desk.
* Include all attendees, coordinators, TAs, guests, and waitlist names.
* Include the name of the event, dates, and room in the body of the email. For
  example.:

    > RailsBridge Boston event on 10/4/2013 from 7pm-10pm and 10/5/2013
    > from 9:30am-5pm in the Mann/Sampson/Paul room

* Send the list as a file attachment to nerdconf@microsoft.com, CC'ing whoever
  our venue contact is and the lead coordinators. Re-emphasize that we
  want the desks set up in U shaped clusters.

## Friday Night (everyone)

#### MC

* Welcome everyone
* Brief intro of what to expect this weekend
* Thank sponsors
  * show logos
  * give special "shout outs" to any organizations that are sponsoring any
