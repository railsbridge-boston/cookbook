# Registration Coordinator

As a Registration Coordinator, you'll be the one setting up, maintaining, and
troubleshooting registration leading up to the event.

## As soon as venue is booked

Create a draft of the registration page.
  - If possible, make it private or [password-protected][protected Eventbrite]
  so that it cannot be publicly-accessed. Be sure to share the password with
  the other coordinators. :)
Create a new poster to market (the pages template is in the google drive under the last event) 

[protected Eventbrite]: eventbrite.md#making-the-event-private

## 5 weeks before

* Update any necessary information on the event page, such as description,
sponsors, start/end times, etc.
* Open up and [announce registration](announcing-registration.md).
* Create an external event link on BridgeTroll (https://www.bridgetroll.org/external_events/new). The external link should be to eventbrite so that there is a single source of truth list of attendees. If you receive an "you are not authorized" error message when going to this link, ask Melissa to give you external event link creation permissions. 

Plan to spend 30-60 minutes per day on the RBB email account after registration
opens; we have some [answers to FAQs](faqs.md).

## Every week leading up to workshops

If a waitlist has been set up, release spots to people on that list as you get cancellations.

## 3 weeks before

* Generate report of all TA applications for the TA Coordinator.

## 2 weeks before

* Generate report of child care requests for the Childcare Coordinator.
* Generate report of dietary restrictions for the Catering Coordinator.
* [Send a reminder email][reminder] to attendees asking them to cancel their spot if plans changed.

[reminder]: sample-emails.md#attendee-reminder-email

## 1 week before

If applicable, send an email to everyone about remembering their IDs for
building security.

## 1-2 days before

If applicable, generate a guest list for the Venue Coordinator. The list should
include the following people:

* All attendees, including those on the waitlist (just in case).
* All teaching staff.
* Coordinators and organizers who plan on being there.
* Any sponsor representatives.

Print out 1-2 hard copies of the guest list for check-in.

## Friday

* Have 2-3 people stationed at the check-in area.
  - People often came in groups and it's sometimes tough to process them all at once.
  - If using Eventbrite, installed the Eventbrite Organizer app can help out a lot.
* Make sure everyone has the following:
  - A name tag
  - 2 sticky notes of different colors
* Track how many people attended vs. no-shows so we can make better predictions in future.
