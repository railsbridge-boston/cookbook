## FAQs

**How many spots can we offer?**

Ideally every seat will be filled, but it's challenging. There are always
cancellations - many of which happen on Friday. Generally speaking, we've been
seeing 50% of the signups + 90% of all volunteers (including organizers)
actually show up.

**I'm on the waitlist. Should I plan to come?**

The last-minute notice is hard on waitlisters. We try to set expectations so they can decide what they want to do. See the current waitlist message.

**What if a waitlister doesn't get a ticket and they really want to learn?**

Invite them to join the [announcement list](http://eepurl.com/vwrQT) so they'll be first to hear about the next workshop. If they want to get started in the meantime, direct them to [Boston Ruby Project Nights](http://bostonrb.org/), held the first Tuesday of every month. Boston RB works hard to welcome newcomers, and they always have at least one person available to help with machine setup and questions.

**Can someone come on Saturday only?**

We strongly prefer that they come both days because the software installation
and setup can be tricky, but we do understand that circumstances can make it
difficult to attend on Friday.

If they can really only come in on Saturday, then we recommend that they arrive
~30 minutes earlier so that a TA can help them catch up.
