## FAQs

**How many spots can we offer?**

Ideally every seat will be filled, but it's challenging. The fire code gives us a hard limit of how many people may be at the workshop site. There are always cancellations, but we don't have a good formula to predict how many. Most cancellations come in on Friday, and many waitlisters have made other plans. We're going to track attendance better so we have more data.

**I'm on the waitlist. Should I plan to come?**

The last-minute notice is hard on waitlisters. We try to set expectations so they can decide what they want to do. See the current waitlist message.

**What if a waitlister doesn't get a ticket and they really want to learn?**

Invite them to join the [announcement list](http://eepurl.com/vwrQT) so they'll be first to hear about the next workshop. If they want to get started in the meantime, direct them to [Boston Ruby Project Nights](http://bostonrb.org/), held the first Tuesday of every month. Boston RB works hard to welcome newcomers, and they always have at least one person available to help with machine setup and questions.

**Can someone come on Saturday only?**

We tried it and it didn't work. Everyone has to come to Installfest so their machine is ready to go on Saturday. We can't catch someone up before the lecture, especially when the network is overloaded. We also cover some foundational materials on Friday, like using the command line, that they'll need for Saturday's curriculum.
